# Python Generators - Task 0

This project initializes a MySQL database and populates it with user data from a CSV file. It introduces the foundation for using generators in later tasks to stream database rows efficiently.

### Files
- `seed.py`: Contains functions to connect, create DB and tables, and insert data.
- `0-main.py`: Entry-point script to run the setup process.
- `user_data.csv`: Source of sample data (name, email, age).

### Usage
```bash
$ python3 0-main.py
